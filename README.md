Home Patrol
==========

A plugin for the Indigo home automation system (http://indigodomo.com)

The Home Patrol plugin is a simple utility that allows you to run through a series of devices or actions in sequence with a user defined interval between each device or action with an option to return back to a "home action" between each.  This was originally designed to use with security cameras to create a scheduled preset patrol but could be adapted to any number of other automation functions.

Requires Indigo 7 or greater.
